# Mobius-strip
This Python script models a MÃ¶bius strip using parametric equations and computes its surface area and edge length numerically. It uses NumPy for mesh generation and integration, and Matplotlib for 3D visualization. The MobiusStrip class encapsulates geometry computation, making it modular and easy to extend.
